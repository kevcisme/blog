# Building an App based on vibes

I have no clue if the world wants or needs an app that prevents your mic from being used as spyware. I don't even really know if the mic on  my phone is being used as spyware. Anecdotally, sure. There's too many times that I've had a convo about something that I am positive is not in my cookies that shows up as an ad. But Data Scientists are smart. They don't need a bunch of explicit signals like my phone's audio to figure out that I would like a targeted ad for golf, right?

I _think_ so. 

But also, it wouldn't hurt to try to impose on that flow, or block it all together, right?

I _think_ so. 

Also, I think that people think like me. There might even be a whole population who feels even more strongly about the idea that their "phone is listening to them" and I wonder if they would pay to have an application that blocks that.

I'm not quite sure from a technical side how this would work either. I believe Apple doesn't give you access to lower level processes like mics, right?

Either way, the vibes are right. I made an awesome logo. ![sileninja logo](/src/assets/sileninja.jpg) Let's goooooooo ðŸš€
