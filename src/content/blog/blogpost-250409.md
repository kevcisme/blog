# Pools, but make it data
Last year, I started running a pool with some friends and family. We did 3 of the 4 Majors in golf. 

This year, I'm doing it again, but now that I've got all the Jupyter notebooks ready to roll, I can focus on building out a website.


## What we're doing

The idea is pretty simple. The players in the pool pick their favorite 7 golfers. Then we sum up the golfers' scores across the days and whoever has the best score, wins.

What makes it data fun: I'm pulling data in from a couple APIs and then doing analytics on our picks. Simple data visuals like heatmaps that show relationships between how one player chose against another player are really fun. 

I'll keep everything updated as time goes on!

## The site

I suppose I can't conceive of a side project at this time that doesn't terminate in a mini-startup. 

For this one, I bought a domain: [Legends Pools](https://www.legendspools.com) and I've been putting all data visuals and the leaderboard up on there.

Plan is to try to automate all of the data stuff and then I can come in and add commentary / interpretation about what's going on in the charts.
