# And in October of '25 he said, let's get a Masters 

### How does this fit into my grand plans?

There's no shortage of projects in my backlog. So how does this plan to get a Masters in AI fit into everything?

## Why _this_ program
I've been looking around at several different online programs. I chose this one because the catalog of courses I can take span every part of tech that I would love to know. If I were to write down a list of "it would be great if I know ___" this program offers it all. So what classes are offered?

### Core Classes
The core consists of 7 "nanodegrees." These look pretty straightforward. I did find it interesting that they offer an Agentic AI class.

As mentioned, these look pretty straightforward for a foundational layer. What interested me most though were the elective courses, which span not just a number of tech stacks, but also into the business side of tech as well.

### Elective Classes

There 50+ elective classes and it is up to the learner to determine which ones are most relevant.
